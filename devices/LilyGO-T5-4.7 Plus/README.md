# Useful information

For simplicity, this project uses the arduino framework within the PlatformIO development environment.

## How to use
Clone this repo and open this folder in VSCode as a platformio project. Build and upload...

*Remark: The first buildtime can take a while since it also includes downloading and building the arduino-esp32 platform code*

## EPD library
Mainboard library. It also contains the required board definition and examples. 

Since this library is included as a dependency in the platformio.ini file, PlatformIO will download it automatically when building the main project.
